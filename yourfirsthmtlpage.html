	<h1 id="top"> Your First Web Page!</h1>

	<h3>Heres an example of what you can make knowing how to make your very first webpage!</h3>
	<p>I am going to list a decent amount of things here that you can use! <br></p>
	<p>Some things you could do are!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A Home Page</li>
		<li>Nav page hearder</li>
		<li>A photo gallery</li>
		<li>Whatever your heart desires!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Did you know that the list above could be turned into a nav bar itself?<br>
	Its a cool feature you should look up! In fact you can turn any unorderd list into a nav pane easily just using HTML!</p>
	
	<img src="http://www.google.com"> <p> this is a broken image I'm too lazy to find but you could add any!</p>
	
	<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com">All of youtube lmao</iframe>
	
	<form>
	<p> If you like this site please click here! <input ="radio" id="yes"></p>
	<p> If you don't like this site please click here instead! <input="radio" id="yes"></p>
	</form>
	
	
	<p>This is just the start of what you could do from learning HTML! Next we can look at CSS to make it all look more inviting.</p>
